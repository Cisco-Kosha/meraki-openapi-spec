# Meraki Connector

The Meraki dashboard API is an interface for software to interact directly with the Meraki cloud platform and Meraki-managed devices. The API contains a set of tools known as endpoints for building software and applications that communicate with the Meraki dashboard for use cases such as provisioning, bulk configuration changes, monitoring, and role-based access controls. The dashboard API is a modern, RESTful API using HTTPS requests to a URL and JSON as a human-readable format. The dashboard API is an open-ended tool that can be used for many purposes. Here are some examples of how it is used today by Meraki customers:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, SSIDs
* Provision thousands of new sites in minutes with an automation script
* Automatically onboard and off-board new employees' teleworker device(s)
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases
